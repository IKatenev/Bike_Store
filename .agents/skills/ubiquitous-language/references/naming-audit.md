# Naming & Ubiquitous Language Audit

Read this when the user asks to audit, review, or check naming consistency in the codebase.
This is a systematic protocol — run it top to bottom, report findings at the end.

## When to Run

- User asks: "audit naming", "check naming consistency", "review ubiquitous language"
- Before a major refactoring or architecture change
- When onboarding to a new codebase
- Periodically (quarterly) to catch drift

## Prerequisites

- `THESAURUS.md` must exist. If it doesn't, run thesaurus generation first
  (see [generating-thesaurus.md](generating-thesaurus.md))
- Read the `## Index` of `THESAURUS.md` before starting — it is the audit's work-list

## Audit Protocol

Run all 9 checks. Collect findings without stopping. Present the full report at the end.

The thesaurus's `## Index` is the work-list for most checks: each line gives the
Identifier to look for and the `avoid:` names to look against. Extract it once:

```bash
# Index lines only
awk '/^## Index/{f=1;next} /^## /{f=0} f && /^- \*\*/' docs/THESAURUS.md
# one avoid-name per line, paired with its canonical Identifier
awk '/^## Index/{f=1;next} /^## /{f=0} f && /avoid:/' docs/THESAURUS.md \
  | sed -E 's/^- \*\*[^*]+\*\* `([^`]+)`.*avoid: (.*)$/\1\t\2/'
```

### Check 0: Thesaurus Integrity

Before auditing code against the thesaurus, check the thesaurus against itself —
a broken registry makes every later check lie.

- **Index ↔ Terms**: every Index line has exactly one `### Term` header and vice versa.
  Header count inside `## Terms` (not `## Unresolved`) must equal the Index line count:
  `awk '/^## Terms/{f=1;next} /^## [^T]/{f=0} f && /^### /' THESAURUS.md | wc -l`
- **Line grammar**: every Index line matches
  ``^- \*\*[^*]+\*\* `[A-Z][A-Za-z0-9]*` kind:[a-z]+( ctx:[A-Za-z]+)?( avoid: .+)?$``;
  Forbidden lines contain `` use: ``; Legacy lines contain `` → ``.
- **Registry invariant**: no name appears in two registry lines. Collect all backticked
  names from Index `avoid:` lists, `## Forbidden`, `## Legacy`; sort; report duplicates.
  Also: no `avoid:` name equals another line's Identifier (SKOS: an altLabel is never
  anyone's prefLabel).
- **Anchor grammar**: every header under `## Terms` matches `^### [^(]+( \([^)]+\))?$`.
- **Hierarchy sanity** (SKOS): the same pair is never both `Broader` and `Related`;
  `Broader` chains have no cycles (A broader B broader A).
- **Bridges vocabulary**: every bridge's mapping is one of
  `exactMatch` `closeMatch` `broadMatch` `narrowMatch` `relatedMatch` `distinct`.
- **Format stamp**: `rg -n '^thesaurus-format:'` must return exactly one line, inside the
  YAML frontmatter at the top of the file, with a quoted `2.x` version. Missing/`1.x` → stop and offer migration (see
  generating-thesaurus.md "Migrating an Existing Thesaurus"); missing but the Index is
  already in 2.0 line grammar → just add the stamp and continue. Stamp says `2.x` but the
  file still has `Synonyms to AVOID` lines or a table Index → stamp lies; report it.
  A stamp newer than this skill's `thesaurus-format` → read-only audit; tell the user to
  update the skill.

**Severity: HIGH** — thesaurus cannot be trusted until fixed.

### Check 1: Synonym Violations

For each Index line, grep the codebase for every name in its `avoid:` list:

```
Line: - **Order** `Order` kind:aggregate avoid: `Purchase`, `Transaction`, `Buy`
→ rg -n -i -w 'purchase|transaction|buy' src/ -t ts -t cs -t py -t java -t go -t ruby
→ filter: only class names, method names, variable names, DB columns (not comments/strings)
```

Report as: `<avoid name>` in `<file:line>` — Index says `<Identifier>`.

**Severity: HIGH** — direct contradiction of the thesaurus.

### Check 2: Forbidden Words in Domain Layer

For each `## Forbidden` line, scan domain-layer code for the word:

```
Work-list: the backticked words of ## Forbidden (project-specific), plus the baseline
  Manager, Handler, Service (bare), Info, Data, Base, Util, Helper, Object, Obj, Record, Model
In: domain layer classes, interfaces, method names (NOT infrastructure layer)
```

If a baseline word is hit but missing from `## Forbidden`, propose adding the line.

**Severity: MEDIUM** — vague naming that hides domain concepts.

### Check 3: Technical Jargon Leak

Scan domain-layer code for implementation-specific prefixes/suffixes:

```
Scan for: Mongo*, Sql*, Http*, Redis*, Kafka*, Elastic*, *Dto, *Entity, *Model, *Record
In: domain layer only (NOT infrastructure/persistence/API layers)
```

**Severity: HIGH** — infrastructure leaking into domain.

### Check 4: Synonym Drift (same concept, multiple names)

Look for groups of identifiers that likely refer to the same domain concept:

- Same-shaped classes in different modules (similar fields, different names)
- API endpoints that use different terms for the same resource
- Database tables/columns with overlapping semantics
- Tests that use different names than the code they test

**Detection heuristics (grep-friendly, no pairwise comparison):**
- Same role suffix with different noun stems: `UserController` vs `CustomerController`,
  `UserRepository` vs `CustomerRepository` — grep for common suffixes, compare stems
- API route vs domain code drift: `/users/...` in routes but `Customer` in domain
- DB column vs code drift: `user_id` in schema but `customerId` in code
- Test vs implementation drift: test descriptions say "user" but code says `Customer`
- Competing stems in the same module: file that imports both `User` and `Customer`

Treat synonym drift as a **local-cluster problem**: same module, same role, different noun.
Do NOT attempt global pairwise class comparison.

**Severity: HIGH** — the ubiquitous language is fractured.

### Check 5: Polysemy (same name, different meanings)

Look for the same identifier used with structurally different meanings:

- Same class name in different packages with different fields/methods
- Same enum name with different values in different modules
- Same method name doing fundamentally different things in different classes
- Same API parameter meaning different things in different endpoints

**The incompatible-verbs test:** If the same word appears as subject of incompatible
verbs in different parts of the code ("Account is charged" vs "Account is logged in"),
it's polysemy.

**Severity: HIGH** — silent bugs waiting to happen.

### Check 6: Translation Chain

Compare terminology across artifact layers:

```
Layer mapping (local artifacts only — do NOT assume access to Jira/Linear/Notion):
  Local docs/ADRs/OpenAPI specs → API controllers → Domain code → DB schema → Test descriptions → Git commit messages

For each major domain concept, trace the name through available local layers.
If external specs are needed, ask the user to paste the relevant text.
```

**Detection method:**
- Pick 3-10 major domain terms from the thesaurus or API surface
- Grep their stems across available local layers
- Check test descriptions (`describe()`/`it()`/`test()` strings) — tests often use
  the domain expert's term while code uses an abbreviation
- Check `git log --oneline -50` — commit messages reveal human intent vs code naming
- Flag any layer where the term changes

**Example finding:**
```
"Campaign" in docs/architecture.md
→ "Promotion" in openapi.yaml
→ `marketing_push` in domain code
→ `promotions` table in DB
→ "advertising effort" in test descriptions
= Translation chain with 4 breaks
```

If some layers are missing locally, report them as `not auditable from local files`.

**Severity: HIGH** — information loss at every translation.

### Check 7: Abbreviation & Naming Inconsistency

Scan for inconsistent forms of the same term:

- Abbreviated vs full: `usr` / `user` / `customer` / `acct` / `account`
- Casing inconsistency: `orderId` in one file, `order_id` in another (within same language)
- Plural inconsistency: `Order` class but `order_items` table vs `orderItem` field

**Severity: LOW** — cosmetic but creates cognitive load.

### Check 8: Orphan Terms

Check for Index terms that no longer appear in code, and code concepts missing from the Index:

```
For each Index line → grep the codebase for the Identifier (also its snake_case form)
If zero matches → term may be obsolete, or not yet implemented — ask

For each `## Legacy` line → grep for the legacy name
If zero matches → the legacy line is done; propose removing it
```

Reverse direction: grep type/class/interface declarations in the domain layer, strip
technical suffixes, and list names that hit neither an Index Identifier, an Avoid
name, nor a Legacy name — candidates for new Index lines.

**Severity: LOW** — thesaurus drift from codebase.

## Report Format

After running all 9 checks, present findings grouped by severity:

```
## Ubiquitous Language Audit Report

**Codebase**: [project name]
**Date**: [date]
**Thesaurus**: [N terms, M legacy, K unresolved]

### Critical (fix now)

1. **Synonym violation**: `fetchPurchases()` in src/api/orders.ts:12
   — Thesaurus says "Order", not "Purchase" — 8 files affected

2. **Polysemy**: `Account` used as financial entity (billing/)
   AND user identity (auth/) — 18 files affected

3. **Translation chain**: "Campaign" → "Promotion" → `marketing_push`
   — 4 translation breaks across 31 files

### Warning (plan to fix)

4. **Weasel word**: `OrderManager` in src/domain/OrderManager.ts
   — "Manager" hides responsibility. What does it actually do?

5. **Technical leak**: `MongoOrder` in src/domain/MongoOrder.ts
   — Infrastructure prefix in domain layer

### Info (track as debt)

6. **Abbreviation**: `usr` in 3 files, `user` in 12, `customer` in 8
   — All refer to the same concept

7. **Orphan term**: "ShippingLabel" in thesaurus, 0 matches in code
   — May be obsolete or not yet implemented

### Stats

| Check | Findings |
|-------|----------|
| Thesaurus integrity | 0 |
| Synonym violations | 3 |
| Forbidden words | 5 |
| Technical leaks | 2 |
| Synonym drift | 4 clusters |
| Polysemy | 1 |
| Translation chains | 2 |
| Abbreviation issues | 6 |
| Orphan terms | 3 |
| **Total** | **26** |

### Recommended Priority

1. Fix polysemy first (silent bug risk)
2. Fix translation chains (information loss)
3. Fix synonym violations (thesaurus credibility)
4. Clean up weasel words (naming quality)
5. Track the rest as naming debt
```

## After the Audit

- **Critical findings**: suggest immediate fixes or add to `## Unresolved` in thesaurus
- **Warnings**: create tech debt tickets or note in thesaurus
- **Info**: note for next audit cycle
- **Update the thesaurus**: add missing Index lines + entries, remove finished Legacy
  lines, extend `avoid:` lists with the synonyms you found in the wild — keeping the
  registry invariant (a name lives under `avoid:` *or* Legacy *or* Forbidden, never two)
- **If no thesaurus existed**: the audit findings ARE the input for thesaurus generation —
  feed them into the generating-thesaurus.md workflow
- **Offer history mining** for the findings the code alone can't settle — synonym drift
  clusters (Check 5), polysemy candidates (Check 6), and anything you had to file under
  `## Unresolved`. Git history says which spelling came first, which commit replaced which,
  and which one is dying: see [git-history-mining.md](git-history-mining.md). Offer it once,
  as an option; skip it when the repo has no usable history
