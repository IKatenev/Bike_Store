# Evolution Patterns

Reusable patterns for changing live code without breaking callers or stalling integration.

## Pattern: Feature Flag (Calendar Flag Variant)

### Intent

Decouple **deploying** code from **releasing** behaviour. Ship an incomplete feature to production behind a configuration switch that is off by default, and flip it on once the feature is ready.

### When to Use

- The work needs staged exposure, crosses risky integration boundaries, or must remain mergeable before release.
- You practice Continuous Integration or Continuous Deployment and can't justify a long-lived branch.
- You need to exercise the new behaviour with integration tests before it's user-visible.

### Structure

```csharp
// 1. Wrapper class (needed for DI containers that reject raw primitives).
public sealed class CalendarFlag
{
    public CalendarFlag(bool enabled) { Enabled = enabled; }
    public bool Enabled { get; }
}

// 2. Config reads the flag; defaults to false if absent.
var calendarEnabled = new CalendarFlag(
    Configuration.GetValue<bool>("EnableCalendar"));
services.AddSingleton(calendarEnabled);

// 3. Code paths gate the new behaviour on the flag.
public IActionResult Get()
{
    var links = new List<LinkDto>();
    links.Add(CreateReservationsLink());
    if (enableCalendar)
    {
        links.Add(CreateYearLink());
        links.Add(CreateMonthLink());
        links.Add(CreateDayLink());
    }
    return Ok(new HomeDto { Links = links.ToArray() });
}

// 4. Tests override the config to turn the feature on.
services.RemoveAll<CalendarFlag>();
services.AddSingleton(new CalendarFlag(true));
```

### Walkthrough

1. Introduce the flag class or config key with a default of "feature off" in production.
2. Wrap new code paths in `if (flag) { ... }`; the rest of the app stays oblivious.
3. Override the flag to `true` in integration tests and in your local/dev config.
4. When the feature is live in production, delete the flag class. The compiler will catch every `if` to simplify; keep only the new branch.

### Benefits

- Keeps CI healthy on multi-week work.
- Decouples deploy from release — code can ship before the feature is announced.
- Integration tests stay meaningful throughout.

### Considerations

- A flag left in place past its useful life becomes a smell. Delete promptly.
- Don't use flags for rollback — that's a deployment concern.
- Do not add a flag when the change has low blast radius, can be verified before merge, and does not need deploy/release separation.

## Pattern: Method-Level Strangler

### Intent

Replace a method (often an interface method) when in-place editing would break too many call sites at once. Let the old and new methods coexist, migrate callers gradually, then delete the old method.

### When to Use

- A method signature needs to change (e.g. wider preconditions, different return type).
- The method is called from many places and you can't fix them all in one commit.
- You want every intermediate commit to be deployable.

### Structure

```csharp
// Step 1. Start state.
public interface IReservationsRepository {
    Task<IReadOnlyCollection<Reservation>> ReadReservations(DateTime dateTime);
    // ...
}

// Step 2. Add the new method beside the old. Implement on every concrete
//         class in the same commit so the build stays green.
public interface IReservationsRepository {
    Task<IReadOnlyCollection<Reservation>> ReadReservations(DateTime dateTime);
    Task<IReadOnlyCollection<Reservation>> ReadReservations(
        DateTime min, DateTime max);      // new
    // ...
}

// Step 3. Migrate callers one at a time; commit after each.
var reservations = await Repository
    .ReadReservations(min, max)           // now using the new overload
    .ConfigureAwait(false);

// Step 4. When no callers remain, delete the old method from the
//         interface and every implementer.
```

### Walkthrough

1. Add the new method to the interface and implement it in every concrete class. Options: full implementation everywhere in one commit; `NotImplementedException` stubs then TDD; or concrete classes first, interface last.
2. With the new method unused, commit and merge.
3. Edit call sites one at a time; commit per call site.
4. When the old method has no callers, delete it from the interface and every implementer (the compiler won't catch this — you must remember).

### Benefits

- Every commit is deployable.
- Work can be interleaved with unrelated tasks.

### Considerations

- Prefer weakening preconditions when designing the new signature (range subsumes single-date).
- Don't forget to delete the old method from every implementer after the interface update.

## Pattern: Class-Level Strangler

### Intent

Replace a class when in-place refactoring would take too long or break too much at once. Add a new class, optionally with a temporary conversion helper, migrate callers, then delete the old class.

### When to Use

- A class was over-engineered (e.g. unnecessary generics) and a simpler type would clarify the code.
- A class's responsibility has drifted and you want to split or rename it without a big-bang edit.
- Multiple callers depend on the class and must be migrated individually.

### Structure

```csharp
// Starting point: the over-engineered generic.
public class Occurrence<T> { /* DateTime At, T Value */ }

// Step 1. Introduce the concrete replacement beside the old class.
public class TimeSlot { /* DateTime At, IReadOnlyCollection<Table> Tables */ }

// Step 2. Temporary bridge between old and new.
internal static TimeSlot ToTimeSlot(
    this Occurrence<IEnumerable<Table>> source) =>
    new TimeSlot(source.At, source.Value.ToList());

// Step 3. If signatures collide (C# has no return-type overloading),
//         rename the old method temporarily.
public IEnumerable<Occurrence<IEnumerable<Table>>> ScheduleOcc( /* old */ );
public IEnumerable<TimeSlot>                       Schedule   ( /* new */ );

// Step 4. Migrate callers one at a time, then delete ScheduleOcc,
//         ToTimeSlot, and Occurrence<T>.
```

### Walkthrough

1. Add the new class. Commit and merge — no behaviour change.
2. If helpful, add a conversion method between old and new, marked `internal` to bound its scope.
3. If language constraints prevent a one-to-one replacement (C# has no return-type overloading), rename the old method to a temporary name (e.g. `ScheduleOcc`) and give the original name to the new method.
4. Migrate callers in coherent, verifiable batches. A systematic transformation may cover many callers at once when the mapping and oracle are trustworthy.
5. When the old class has no callers, delete it along with the conversion helper.

### Benefits

- Each meaningful checkpoint is verified and leaves a clear recovery path.
- Old and new can run side by side indefinitely.
- Teammates can keep working during the migration.

### Considerations

- Conversion helpers and temporary renames are scaffolding — remove them at the end.
- If migration remains incomplete across integrations, document it and prevent new uses of the old class.

## Pattern: Expand-Contract (Database and Schema Migration)

### Intent

Change a live database schema (or any durable store contract) without a single-step destructive migration. Expand the schema, migrate readers and writers, then contract away the old shape — each stage separately deployable and reversible.

### When to Use

- Adding, renaming, splitting, or removing a column, table, field, or index on a production schema.
- Any schema change where a mixed fleet of old and new application versions may run concurrently.
- Backfills that must complete before the old representation can be removed.

### Structure

Three stages, each its own deployable unit:

1. **Expand** — add the new representation (nullable column, new table, new field) without removing the old. Dual-write or backfill so both shapes hold the data.
2. **Migrate readers** — point all readers (and eventually writers) at the new representation; verify with a migration rehearsal against a production-like copy.
3. **Contract** — remove the old column, path, or dual-write once nothing depends on it.

Never combine expand and contract into one destructive step on a live schema.

### Walkthrough

1. Ship the expand migration: new nullable column / table / field. Application still reads the old path; optionally dual-writes.
2. Backfill historical rows; monitor dual-write consistency.
3. Deploy readers that prefer the new field (with fallback if needed), then writers that only write the new field.
4. Confirm no remaining readers of the old path (search, metrics, dual-write lag at zero).
5. Ship the contract migration: drop the old column/path. Keep each step reversible until the contract is proven.

### Benefits

- Old and new application versions can coexist during rollout.
- Each stage is a recovery point; a bad reader deploy rolls back without schema loss.
- Backfill pressure is visible and measurable before the old shape disappears.

### Considerations

- Dual-write windows are temporary debt — record an owner and exit condition.
- Rehearse against a production-like copy before the expand or contract that cannot be trivially undone.
- Coordinate with Expand-Contract at the API layer when external clients also see the shape change.
