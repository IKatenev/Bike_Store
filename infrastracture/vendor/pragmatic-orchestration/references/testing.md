# Testing

The default suite uses fake backend CLIs, is offline, and spends no model tokens:

```bash
scripts/tests/run.sh
```

It covers backend argv safety, exact profile selection, model/effort resolution, stdout/stderr separation, artifacts, Grok streaming success/failure, live progress, credential redaction, prompt purity, all review progress styles, invocation-specific keys, human-readable ids, steerable adapters/mailbox lifecycle, concurrent Grok queue/sendNow behavior, a Devin ACP fake covering one-shot and steerable paths (same-turn merge, cancel), cancel/idempotency/cleanup, and shared runtime contracts.

Quota parsing is tested offline for Codex multi-bucket limits, Grok `/usage`
fields, fail-closed display drift, shell-safe remote paths, and one bounded retry
after a transient Grok transport failure.

The shared-runtime checks include the closed event schema and protocol-drift rejection, backend capability resolution, declarative workflow plans and concurrency defaults, prompt-layer purity, fail-closed mode policy, and debug tape bounds.

Orchestration regressions also cover observer timeouts and interruption without
worker cancellation, wait-any readiness and dead-process handling, failed-abort
replacement rejection, durable Codex native resume, preserved original records,
profile/root mismatches, concurrent continuations, and no replay after failure.
Run this focused suite with `PYTHONPATH=scripts/lib python3
scripts/tests/steer/test_orchestration.py` from the skill directory.

Group-wait checks cover retained acknowledged statuses without repeated wakeups,
elapsed times, unrelated-run exclusion, and rejection of invalid acknowledgements.
Backend environment checks ensure nested delegation cannot inherit the parent's
artifact destination while preserving registry and output-root routing.

Edge cases include backend startup failure beside a healthy peer, simultaneous
success/failure/cancellation, lock contention during dead-supervisor observation,
structured results without final text, Codex active-turn status, and streamed
message completion without duplicate progress text.

OpenCode regressions exercise a permission-blocked fake server through detached
launch and wait-any, retained failure details, tool command visibility, nested
foreign-session filtering, and SSE lines larger than 64 KiB with Unicode content.

Opt-in real smoke tests spend tokens:

```bash
PORCH_STEER_SMOKE=1 bash scripts/tests/steer/smoke_real.sh -a grok
```

## Cross-platform checks

Run `python scripts/tests/platform_test.py -v` from the skill directory with
native Python (3.11+). These tests spend no model tokens and cover all steer
imports, non-destructive PID probes, locks shared by two processes, nonblocking
wait deadlines, exclusive session claims/no replay, process-tree cleanup,
terminal-guard shutdown, and native supervisor Codex continuation. Windows also
checks Python/shell/batch launcher argument handling. Steering guidance after
options is tested on Python 3.11 as well as newer runtimes. Symlink rejection is
checked where the OS permits creating symlinks.

GitHub Actions runs these checks on Windows, Linux, and macOS, plus LF-only
config output and CLI help. The full existing shell suite runs on Linux/macOS;
its POSIX path and executable assumptions are not a Windows gate yet.
